Can you keep a secret?

Since cheating is getting harder and harder at school, I thought I'd relay some knowledge onto everyone. 


Assignments not on external websites:

FIRST: Look up the question WORD FOR WORD on Google.

If your teachers are like mine, they'll get worksheets from teacherspayteachers, a place where they pay a small amount of money ($1.00+) for a worksheet.
Unfortunately for them, these questions are mostly pulled from a teacher workbook. This is fortunate for us because these workbooks are public resources, meaning
the questions inside are often pulled from other sources/uploaded to other sources such as Quizizz or Quizlet.

SECOND: Look for question on Brainly and other resources such as that.

If it isn't on the first page of Google, it probably isn't going to be findable. Luckily, you can ask people to do it for you on Brainly. Simply register an account
or use your already existing one and give the lowest amount of points (which is 10). If you run out, simply make another account using a fake email or a temp. mail
(temp-mail.org). Although unreliable, it may work. Just pray the person who answers actually knows what they're doing.

THIRD (Last resort.): Ask friends for help.

Yeah, you heard me. Ask your friends on Discord, Twitter, whatever. The littlest thing could help.


Assignments on Quizizz:

FIRST: Google the question and add "quizizz".

Just press CTRL+SHIFT+I and hover over the question, double-click the text and CTRL+C. Now, paste it into Google and add "quizizz" to the end, you'll
find it pretty quickly. 

SECOND: Join the game (LIVE GAME not HOMEWORK) with another account.

Just make a dummy account, plain and simple. Just give it a fake name or something or put your name and tell the teacher "I got kicked out." and play again,
make sure to exit before the last question though, or else your albi will sound questionable.


Anything else:

ONLY ONE: Use a mixture of the methods mentioned above.

Sometimes, teachers can use really foreign sites for student testing or create original questions. If so, just simply look up the problem on Google,
to evade cheaters they'll change the names of the people in word problems (Mr. Gary -> Mr. Smith). Just try your hardest, make an educated guess. 
Sometimes, asking the teacher for help could impact you immensely. I'd suggest trying to pay attention, I understand it's boring and for some it's hard
but you won't be able to cheat forever. Mark my words.

Websites for cheating:
http://www.mathway.com - Very nice and complex math calculator with a neat interface. 
http://www.brainly.com - Ask others for help here.
http://www.medlibrary.org/ - Homework database, unreliable due to it being hit-or-miss if the worksheet has a cheat sheet.
http://www.coursehero.com/ - A site for sharing PDFs, most of the site is locked behind a paywall.
http://www.answers.com/ - Brainly but for EVERYTHING.
http://www.quora.com/ - Basic question-and-answer website. Similar to the one listed above.
https://www.studymode.com/ - Essay EXAMPLES. Make sure to write it in your own words. Do not just copy.
